<h1>Helping Canadians go paperless.</h1>
<p>The <strong>Verifiable Organizations Network</strong> is a government-backed initiative to make government-issued documents&mdash;like IDs, permits, and licenses&mdash;fully digital. By using modern, blockchain-based technologies, a paperless system would help make:
  <ol>
    <li>applying for documents faster and less error prone</li>
    <li>issuing (and reissuing) documents simpler and more secure, and</li>
    <li>verifying documents more standard, trustworthy, and transparent across our nation.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>Our initial proof-of-concept, <a href="https://devex-von-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/en/home">TheOrgBook</a>, is publically accessible, <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook">open-sourced</a>, and <a href="https://devex-von-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/en/org/110" target="_blank">shows what future business permits and licenses could look like</a>.</p>
