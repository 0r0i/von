[OrgBook BC](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca) and the [Verifiable Organizations Network (VON)](https://vonx.io) development team are getting attention from the Linux Foundation, most recently in a blog post about the BC case study with Hyperledger Indy. The post fully details the evolution and success of the project, outlining how the VON ecosystem will help establish a better way to find, issue, store and share trustworthy data about organizations—locally and around the globe. 

Beginning with the question that started it all: “Can we create a quick and easy way to navigate through the maze of services from your local, provincial, or federal governments?”  asked by product lead John Jordan, the post describes the shared development and open source approach the team took, how they searched for a suitable framework (which turned out to be the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Indy), and how they expanded on the code and contributed it back to the Linux Foundation. 

One of the more remarkable aspects of this project is the fact that the BC government is taking an “open by default” approach and OrgBook BC and VON prove it works well—saving the government (and taxpayer) time and money. 

Jinny Sims, Minister of BC Citizens’ Services sums it up best: “OrgBook BC has unlimited potential to improve the way companies interact with the province, whether they are a small, family-owned business or a large credit union. We’re bringing new partners onto OrgBook BC and expanding its capabilities to help our job creators spend less time on paperwork and more time growing their companies.”
