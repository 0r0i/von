The Hyperledger developer community held an agent Connect-A-Thon in Utah February 19-22, 2019 and three developers from the BC government emerging technologies team were in attendance. The collaboration from the Connect-A-Thon resulted in the specification of agent protocols, different groups building agents, and a chance to prove that the agents could talk to one another.

The BC government team went on to further develop their agent, resulting in AgentBook, a single, centrally running agent registry (or agent directory). AgentBook was premiered to the local community at the BCTech Summit, [Hyperledger Indy Bootcamp](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R9z_4ih-N6-tjgBni8HYpjBLSqrOCG0ag4G_oZwb1Mw/edit?usp=sharing), on March 11, 2019 and then to the world on March 14, 2019 through an Indy Working Group call. 

Using AgentBook, approximately 30 people from South Africa, Europe, Canada and the USA were able to build and run their own Hyperledger Indy agent, connect with other agents using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to establish a secure communication mechanism, and using that communication mechanism, send messages to each other. While it may not sound like much, the important parts to consider are: 

* The messaging between the agents was encrypted solely for the use of the connected participantsâ€”no one else could listen in. 
* These secure, peer-to-peer multi-agent connections were made possible through the exchange of cryptographic keys and the agent-to-agent messaging protocols implemented by each agent.
* This work illustrates the potential for DID-based technologies, such as Hyperledger Indy, to change for the better how data is handled on the Internet.
