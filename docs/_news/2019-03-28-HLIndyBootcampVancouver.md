As part of the [BCTech Summit](https://www.bctechsummit.ca/), core maintainers of the [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) and [Verifiable Organizations Network (VON)](https://vonx.io) open source projects, and representatives of the [Sovrin Foundation](https://sovrin.org/), put on a one-day bootcamp to give developers, business people and members of the public some hands-on experience with core blockchain-for-identity concepts and implementations. The Honourable Jinny Sims, Minister of Citizens' Services and MLA for Surrey-Panorama, opened the bootcamp, citing how proud she was of her BC team for leading the way with this emerging technology.

Held at the Vancouver Convention Center on March 11, 2019, about 60 people took part in the bootcamp. The agenda included a lively skit by the presenters that demonstrated the schism between our day-to-day human relationships versus how online relationships work today, and how peer-to-peer connections and verifiable credentials can be used to align our online and offline relationships. An introduction to self-sovereign identity and the Sovrin Foundation Network was led by Sam Curren, Software Architect with Sovrin. The first hands-on session had participants building an agent and sending messages to other agents in the audience. This first-of-its-kind demo showed how this technology could be used to create cryptographically secure, peer-to-peer connections between individuals.

In the afternoon, Carol Prest, Registrar and Executive Director for the Province of British Columbia, and John Jordan, Executive Director, Emerging Digital Initiatives, Ministry of Citizens' Services, introduced the [VON](https://vonx.io), a project to enable organizations—and the people running those organizations—to conduct business online in a trusted manner. Participants then were given the opportunity to create their own agent and issue a verifiable credential.
