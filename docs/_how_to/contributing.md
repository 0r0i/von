This section of the VON documentation is about contributing to the project. If you and/or your team are interested in joining the fun, read on for some guidance on how to participate in alignment with how we are running this Open Source project.

Of course, if all you want to do is fork the project repos and submit issues and/or pull requests, we're happy with that. The practices covered here are if you want to be more tightly tied to the project - joining the team meetings, tracking our sprints, and contributing documentation.

# Overview

## Sprints

The current team meets every second Wednesday (from May 23, 2018) at 10AM Pacific, 1PM Eastern for Sprint Planning - let us know if you would like to join us and we'll add you to the invitation. At that time, we review work accomplished, roadblocks, and work planned for the next Sprint. Sprints are tracked using github issues and [zenhub](https://zenhub.com), as described in [this document]({{ "/how_to/tracking-issues/" | relative_url }}).

The team meets Monday, Friday, and non-Sprint planning Wednesdays at 8:45AM Pacific/11:45AM Eastern for daily standups.

## Documentation

This site is the primary documentation site for the project. See [this document]({{ "/how_to/updating-docs/" | relative_url }}) for how to update, correct or expand the documents on this site. It's all run off github, so as with the code - the documentation is driven by pull requests.

## Code Documentation

We're using [Sphinx](https://http://www.sphinx-doc.org) to generate code documentation. Information on using Sphinx can be found [here]({{ "/how_to/generating-code-docs/" | relative_url }})
