Want to join us online as we work on VON?  If so, please join the discussions we are having on the BC Gov Rocket.Chat instance.

## Joining the BC Gov Rocket.Chat

The BC Gov Rocket.Chat instance uses IDir for BC Gov folks and GitHub with two-factor authentication (2FA) for external (non-BC Gov) user authentication.

### First Connection

To join the instance:

- If you have an IDir, you can go to [https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca](https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca).
- If you don't have an IDir (and have no clue what that is), you will need to send one of us the email address **associated with your GitHub account** so that we can send you an invitation to join.
  - If the invitation fails it will likely be because you gave us an email that is **not** associated with a GitHub account, **OR** you waited too long to process the invitation and it expired. Please figure out which occurred, contact us again, and we'll send you out another invitation.

### Rocket.Chat Clients

You can use the either the Rocket.Chat web client (at [https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca](https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca)) or download and install a native app for your system. There are also Rocket.Chat Android and iOS apps. Downloads are available from the [Rocket.Chat website](https://rocket.chat/install)

## Leave *devops and *labops Channels

The Pathfinder Rocket.Chat instance automatically adds new subscribers to a series of channels. If you are a non-BC Gov user, you will want to leave those channels. Mouse over the channel, click the "triple dot" menu and select "Leave Room" for each of:

* devops-\*
* labops-\*
* general
* kudos
* random
* rocketchat-help

## Join von-* public channels and direct message

Use the search icon above the (possibly empty) channel list to search for the `von-` public channels and join at least the `von-general` channel. Once you join `von-general`, please announce yourself with a quick "hello". We need that so we can add you to any private channels that you should be a part of.

You can also search for other folks on the extended VON team and start direct messaging them.

That should be it&mdash;you are good to go!
